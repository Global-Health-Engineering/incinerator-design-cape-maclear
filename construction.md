# Introduction
This document present the construction of a modified De Montfort Incinerator Mark 8A, which was designed and built between October and December 2023 in Cape Maclear, Malawi. The incinerator presents several modifications compared to the original design, particularly an ash collection box  [1] and a cyclone separator to filter the outgoing gases.
The construction of this incinerator is part of a broader project conducted by Global Health Engineering, a ETH research group, which aims to introduce regular waste collection in the village of Cape Maclear, ensuring safe waste disposal and minimizing contamination as much as possible. 
The main goal of the incinerator is to reduce waste volume and make hazardous waste harmless, emphasizing cost-effectiveness and minimizing risks.

# Incinerator Overview
The incinerator is a small-sized incinerator composed of a structure of refractory bricks and cement with a metal frame on the top. The interior space is divided into two combustion chambers: the first can be accessed by the operator through a door located at its top, allowing for inserting of a new waste bag. The second combustion chamber and the attached cyclone separator remain inaccessible to the operator and are solely intended for the  treatment of fumes. The purpose of the second combustion chamber is to reduce carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide through secondary combustion while the cyclone separator allow to reduce the PM in the exiting gasses.
About the performance: the incinerators can burn about 3.5 kg h−1 reaching temperature of 770°C. While the mass of the ashes produced by the incinerators represent about 20-30% of total mass of waste burnt.
