The first step in the construction of the incinerator is the fabrication of the metal parts, these include:

**Ash tray** is composed of a box made of 3 mm-thick metal plates, welded together with a removable grid, build from two angular profiles on the sides. They are connected with a 10 mm armament bar creating a grid on which the unburned waste lays (see Figure 1 for exact dimensions and Figure 2 for construction details).

**Loading door and its frame** allow for an easy access to the primary combustion chamber. The loading door is composed of a 3 mm steel plate with angular profiles on the sides. The door is connected to the frame with a hinge and a M 10 threaded bar. The frame has a U-shaped cross-section to seal the movable parts with sand placed in the U-shaped channel.

**Cover of the secondary combustion chamber and its frame** allow to close the secondary combustion chamber with a steel plate that is free to dilatate without avoiding leaking of gas and breaking the incinerator's concrete walls.

**Cyclone separator** was built from a 200 l empty oil drum, cut by hand with shears, a hammer, and a chisel. The barrel has to be opened to create three pieces: the central, cylindrical body, the lower cone, and the inlet tube. The parts needs to be welded together and attached to the chimney and the support plate (see Figure 3 for exact measurements).
