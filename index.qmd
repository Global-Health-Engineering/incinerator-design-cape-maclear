# Introduction {#sec-intro}

This video presents the construction of a modified De Montfort Incinerator Mark 8A, designed and built between October and December 2023 in Cape Maclear, Malawi. The incinerator presents several modifications compared to the original design [^1], e.g., the ash collection drawer [^2] and the cyclone separator to filter the flue gases.

The construction of the incinerator is part of a broader project conducted by Global Health Engineering, an ETH research group, which aims to introduce regular waste collection in the township of Cape Maclear, Malawi, ensuring safe waste disposal and minimizing environmental contamination. This incinerator reduces waste volume and  makes hazardous waste harmless, emphasizing cost-effectiveness.

# Incinerator Overview {#sec-overview}

The incinerator built within this work is a small-size incinerator, composed of a structure of refractory bricks and cement with a metal frame on the top. The interior space is divided into two combustion chambers; the first can be accessed by the operator through a door located at its top, allowing for inserting of a new waste bag. The second combustion chamber and the attached cyclone separator remain inaccessible to the operator and are intended solely for to treat the fumes. The purpose of the second combustion chamber is to reduce carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide through secondary combustion (and combustion time increase), while the cyclone separator allow to reduce the particulate matter (PM) in the fume gasses.

The incinerators can burn about 3.5 kg/h of waste, reaching temperature of 770°C. The mass of the ashes produced by the incinerators represent about 20-30% of total mass of waste burnt.
